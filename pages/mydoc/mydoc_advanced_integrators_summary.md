## Overview
Here's a handy table of what we've learned over the last few articles.

| Method | Position Error | Velocity Error | Symplectic | A-stable |
|-------|--------|---------|---------|---------|
| Explicit Euler | $$\mathcal{O}(h)$$ | $$\mathcal{O}(h)$$ | No | No |
| Symplectic Euler | $$\mathcal{O}(h)$$ | $$\mathcal{O}(h)$$ | Yes | No |
| Velocity Verlet | $$\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$$ | $$\mathcal{O}(h^{2})$$ | Yes | No |
| Backward Euler | $$\mathcal{O}(h)$$ | $$\mathcal{O}(h)$$ | No | Yes |
| Implicit Midpoint Method | $$\mathcal{O}(h)$$ | $$\mathcal{O}(h)$$ | Yes | Yes |

So if your simulation is not very heavy on physics Symplectic Euler is probably okay. 
Otherwise you'll want to go with Verlet. 
Implicit methods like the Gaussâ€“Legendre methods (of which implicit midpoint is the simplest) should be reserved for particularly stubborn 
differential equations as they are expensive.
