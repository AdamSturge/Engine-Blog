## Welcome

This technical blog is a companion site to a project I've been working on exploring the world of physical simulations and rendering. Not surprisingly much of my interest in this field comes from growing up as a gamer. But beyond that I view it as a natural culmination of my interests in Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science. So if like me you're fascinated by how the fantastic worlds of the entertainment industry come to life, then maybe you'll enjoy this blog. 

## What this is
The aim of this site is to give me a place to write articles that explain the details of building a simulation engine. I use the phrase simulation engine here instead of something more familiar like say game engine because the topics covered are going to be heavily biased towards my own interests. As such many of the core components of a game engine such as game audio are left on the cutting room floor. I'll be doing my best to explain the concepts in such a way that someone who has never seen them before can follow along. However that begs the question of what I can assume the reader already knows. 

## What this isn't  
Since I obviously need to assume some level of prior knowledge I'll state what this site isn't. I will not be teaching you:
* C++
* OpenGL
* Linear Algrbra
* Calculus 
* Basic Trigonometry

If you are unfamilar with some of these items there are a wealth of fantastic tutorials online for free. For OpenGL I reccomend [LearnOpgenGL](https://learnopengl.com/)
